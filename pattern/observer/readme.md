The observer pattern solves a fairly common problem: What if a group of objects needs to update themselves when some object changes state? This can be seen in the “model-view” aspect of Smalltalk’s MVC (model-view-controller), or the almost-equivalent “Document-View Architecture.” Suppose that you have some data (the “document”) and more than one view, say a plot and a textual view. When you change the data, the two views must know to update themselves, and that’s what the observer facilitates. It’s a common enough problem that its solution has been made a part of the standard java.util library.
